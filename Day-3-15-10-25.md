# Day 3 (15/10/2025) of Shell-Scripting  
## LOOPS  
* For Loop :
```
#for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
for i in {1..10}
do
	echo "Number is $i"
done

for name in Avesh Raju Yash
do
	echo "Name is $name"
done

```
* For Loop with file:
```
#Getting values from a file names.txt 

FILE="/home/aveshpadaya/shell-scripting/names.txt"

for name in $(cat $FILE)
do
	echo "Name is $name"
done

```
* For Loop with Array:
```
myArray=( 1 2 3 Hello "My Name is Avesh")
length=${#myArray[*]}

for (( i=0;i<$length;i++ ))
do
	echo "Values of the $i index in Array is ${myArray[$i]}"
done

```
* While Loop: It is executed till it get False.
```
count=0
num=10

while [[ $count -le $num ]]
do
	echo "value of count is $count"
	let count++
done

```
* Until Loop: It is executed till it gets True
```
a=10

until [[ a -eq 1 ]]
do
	echo "value of a is $a"
	let a--
done

```
* Infinite with While and for Loop:
```
#Infinte Loop with while loop

while true
do
	echo "Hii"
	sleep 2s
done

```
```
for (( ; ; ))
do
  # Commands to run infinitely
  echo "This runs forever"
  sleep 1
done

```
* while loop with file:
```
while read myVar
do
	echo "Value from File is $myVar"
done < names.txt

```
* while with csv:
```
#while IFS="," read  id name age
cat test.csv | awk 'NR!=1 {print}' | while IFS="," read id name age
do
	echo "ID is $id"
	echo "name is $name"
	echo "age is $age"
done

```
## Functions
It is a Block of code which perform a specific task. when it is called.  
```
# create a function
function welcomeNote {
echo "------------------"
echo "welcome"
echo "------------------"
}
Start() {
echo "------------------"
echo "Start"
echo "------------------"
}
# To call a Function

welcomeNote
welcomeNote
welcomeNote
Start
Start

```
* Arguments in Functions  
```
function welcomeNote {
echo "------------------"
echo "welcome $1 "
echo "Age is $2"
echo "------------------"
}
welcomeNote Avesh 23

```
* > calculator Problem for practice
```

function multiply {

	let m=$1*$2
	echo "The Multiplication of $1 and $2 = $m "
}

function addition {

        let a=$1+$2
        echo "The Addition of $1 and $2 = $a "
}

function subtraction {

        let s=$1-$2
        echo "The Subtraction of $1 and $2 = $s "
}

function division {

        let d=$1/$2
        echo "The Divition of $1 and $2 = $d "
}

echo "select an Operation"
echo "a) Multiplication"
echo "b) Addition"
echo "c)Subtraction"
echo "d)Divition"

read choice
case $choice in 
	a) 
		read -p "Enter the number 1: " num1
		read -p "Enter the number 2: " num2
		multiply $num1 $num2
		;;
	b)
		read -p "Enter the number 1: " num1
                read -p "Enter the number 2: " num2
                addition  $num1 $num2
		;;
	c)
		read -p "Enter the number 1: " num1
                read -p "Enter the number 2: " num2
                subtraction $num1 $num2
		;;
	d)
		read -p "Enter the number 1: " num1
                read -p "Enter the number 2: " num2
                division $num1 $num2
		;;
	*)
		echo "Input is Invalid"
esac

```
* Passing Arguments
For print all arguments we use `$@`
for geting total number of arguments we use `$#`
Also i have mentioned about for loop
```
# to access the Arguments 

echo "First Argument is $1"
echo "second Argument is $2"

echo "All the arguments are - $@"
echo "Number of Arguments are - $#"

# for loop to access the values from arguments
for filename in $@
do 
	echo "Copying file - $filename"
done

# in this when we are running the script give the arguments like
# bash script.sh arg1 arg2

```
* Shifting Arguments.
when we give multiple arguments We can use shift

> I used command `bash script.sh Avesh devops Nuvo Ai`

so avesh will be at $1 place and all the other will be at `$@`


```
# for user creation, provide username and description

echo "Creating User"
echo "username is $1"

shift
echo "description is $@"

```
