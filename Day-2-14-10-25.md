# Day 2 (14/10/2025) of Shell-Scripting    
## Arrays  
This is how we can define a Array and print the specific index or all

```
Array = ( 1 2 3.5 hello "I am avesh")
echo "${Array[0]}"
echo "${Array[*]}"
```

To get the length of an Array we do  

```
echo " The length of the Array is - ${#Array[*]}"
```

how to get The Specific values from a Array  

```
echo "To get a array index 2 and i want only 2 values so i used this command ${Array[*]:2:2}"
```

To update an Array  
```
Array += ( new 30 40 )
```
To Declare a Array Key value  
```
declare -A Array
Array= ( [Name]=Avesh [Age]=23 )
echo "${Array[name]}"
```
## String Operation  
* Length: to get the length of the string
```
myVar="Hii My Name is NUVO AI"
length = ${#myVar}
echo "$length"
```

* Upper case: It is  to make whole string in Uppercase.
```
Upper= ${myVar^^}
echo "$upper"
```

* Lower case: It is to make a Whole string in Lower Case.
```
Lower=${myVar,,}
echo "$Lower"
```

* replace: It is To Replace a Word in a String.
```
Replace= ${myVar/NUVO/Avesh}
echo "$Replace"
```

* slice: It is to get the or print the part of the String.
```
Slice= ${myVar:6:5}
#6 represent the Starting index and 5 reprensents the total number of characters we want after 6 index.
```
## User Interaction  
To get  The inputs from user and to interact with user we use read command.  
```
echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo "Your Name is $name"
# to use echo and read in one command we use
read -p "What is your name?- " name
echo "Your Name is $name"
```
## Arithmatic operation  
* use of let for doing Arithmetic operation
```
x=10
y=2
let a = $x*$y
echo "The multi is $a"
```

* also use (()) for that
```
echo "the sub is $(($x-$y)) "
```
## Condition Statements  
* If-else:
```
if [$marks -gt 40]
then
     echo " You are pass! "
else
     echo " You are Fail!!! "
fi
```
* Elif:
```
if [$marks -ge 80]
then
     echo " A Grade "
elif [$marks -ge 60]
then
     echo " B Grade "
else
     echo " You are Fail!!! "
fi
```
* case:
```
echo "Provide an Option."
echo "a for print date"
echo "b for list scripts "
echo "C for check the current location." 

read choice

case $choice in
        a)date;;
        b)ls;;
        c)pwd;;
        *)echo "please provide a valid input"
esac
```

read -p "What is your Age? " age
read -p "What is your Country? " country
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ] && [ "$country" = "India" ]

```
OR Operation : || : if any one is true then true otherwise false.  
```
read -p "What is your Age? " age
read -p "What is your Country? " country
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ] || [ "$country" = "India" ]
then
    echo "You can Vote!!"
else
    echo "You cannot Vote!!!"
fi

```
ternary operation : cond1 && cond2 || cond3  
```
# cond 1 && cond 2 || cond 3

age=18
[[ $age -ge 18 ]] && echo "Adult" || echo "Minor"
