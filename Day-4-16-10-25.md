# Day 4 (16/10/2025) of Shell-Scripting  
## Some other Concepts  
* break: To stop The loop / Iteration
```
#example for break
#searching for number if it found then present 

read -p "Enter The number for Find - " no
count=0

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
do
	if [[ $no -eq $i ]]
	then 
		echo "$no is Found!"
		let count++
		break
	fi
done

if [[ $count -gt 0 ]]
then
	echo "The Number is Successfully Found"
else
	echo "The Number is Not Present!!"
fi

```
* Continue: To skip The one iteration of loop and continue after that loop.
```
# for Example continue to skip one iteration
# SO we are printing odd values
echo "Odd no. are: "
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
do
	let r=$i%2
	if [[ $r -eq 0 ]]
	then
		continue
	fi
	echo "$i"
done

```
* sleep: to sleep for some Time. like eg: 2s/2m
* exit: It is used end the script eg: exit 1
* exit status `$?`: it is used for checking if he command run successfully or not .
```
read -p "Enter the Site for connection check? - " site

ping -c 1 $site
#sleep 3s

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
then
	echo "Successfully Connection to $site"
else 
	echo "Unable To connect to $site"
fi

```
* basename: It is used for strip dir info and it will only list the specific file that is provided
* dirname:It willshow in which directory the file is stored
* realpath: it will search the file from anywhere and give you the file path with name
* If folder/ file exist: It is to check whether the provided path file is there or not.
>  we write following Commands

Folder exist : `if [[ -d folder_name ]]`  
folder not exist : `if [[ ! -d folder_name ]]`  
File exist: `if [[ -f $filepath ]]`  
File not exist : `if [[ ! -f $filepath ]]`  

```
FILEPATH="/home/aveshpadaya/shell-scripting/avesh.csv"

if [[ -f $FILEPATH ]]
then
	echo "File exist!"
else
	echo "creating File !"
	touch $FILEPATH
	exit 1
fi

```
## Bash Variables:
* Random : It is used to generate a number from 0 to 32767
```
# Generating a random no. for Dice between 1 to 6

NO1=$(( $RANDOM % 6 + 1 ))
NO2=$(( $RANDOM % 6 + 1 ))

echo "Dice 1 is $NO1 "
echo "Dice 2 is $NO2 "

let s=$NO1+$NO2

echo "Total Score is $s "

```
* UID : It tells the user Id of the user logged in.
```
# checking if the user is root or not


if [[ $UID -eq 0 ]]
then 
	echo "User is Root"
else
	echo "User is not Root"
fi

```
* Redirection in scripts: it is redirect a output of command to a file `>` for first time and `>>` it is used or append.
```
example
#ls > file.log
#pwd >> file.log
-------------
#!/bin/bash

ping -c 1 www.google.com > redirect.sh

```
* Dev/null :  if we dont want to print the output nor want to store in file then we use this to send the output to trash.
```
cd /root/ &> /dev/null
```
* Print name of script: It is used to get the name of the script file and used durig log find.
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "The name of the Script is ${0}" > redirect.log

ping -c 1 www.google.com >> redirect.log

```
* Logger: If you want to store log then you can use logger in your script. you can find the logger under /var/logs/messages
> NOTE : It is not used in latest so we have to enable it or we can make a log file and store the logs.
```
#!/bin/bash

#example of logging 

logger "This is log from ${0}"

```
* Debugging Scripts: we can enable Debugging of script using `set -x` in the script start and `set -e` is used to exit if command fails.
```
#!/bin/bash
set -x
set -e
pwd
date
cd /root
hostname
```
## Automate using AT and Crontab  
* AT : It is used to automate and schedule a single task at specific time we can use this the systax is below:
  1. For scheduling a Task
  ```
  at 12:09 PM
     <Your_command>
  EOT : It is done using ctrl + d
  ```
  2. For checking the list of task `atq`
  3. for deleting the task we have scheduled : `atrm <jobid>`
> NOTE : we can also describe the date and time as we want.

* crontab : to do a task everyday at specific time then we use crontab.
  1. to check the existing jobs : `crontab -l`
  2. to add new job : `crontab -e`

syntax  

`*(min) *(hr) *(day) *(month) *(weekday) cd /home/user/scripts && ./script.sh > new.log ` : https://crontab.guru/
