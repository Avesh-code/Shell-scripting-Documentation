## OSI Model
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model standardizes communication into **7 layers**, each with specific network responsibilities.

| Layer | Name         | Function                              | Example Protocols     |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1     | Physical     | Transmits raw bits over hardware mediums | Ethernet, Wi-Fi      |
| 2     | Data Link    | Manages MAC addressing and error-free transmission | ARP, Ethernet        |
| 3     | Network      | Handles IP addressing and routing    | IPv4, IPv6, ICMP     |
| 4     | Transport    | Ensures reliable delivery            | TCP, UDP             |
| 5     | Session      | Maintains and syncs communication sessions | RPC, NetBIOS         |
| 6     | Presentation | Data formatting, compression, encryption | SSL, TLS, JPEG        |
| 7     | Application  | User interfaces and network services | HTTP, FTP, SMTP      |

Understanding these layers helps DevOps engineers troubleshoot communication between systems, from containers to distributed microservices.

## TCP/IP Model
**TCP/IP** is the practical implementation of the OSI model used in most modern networks.

**Layers:**
- **Network Interface:** Handles physical transmission.
- **Internet:** Provides logical addressing (IP) and packet routing.
- **Transport:** End-to-end connectivity (TCP or UDP).
- **Application:** Interfaces with end-user applications (HTTP, DNS, etc.).

**TCP vs UDP:**
- **TCP:** Reliable, ordered communication (used in web and email).
- **UDP:** Faster, connectionless communication (used in streaming, DNS).

---

## IP Addressing, Subnetting, and CIDR
An **IP address** identifies a device uniquely on a network.

- **IPv4:** 32-bit format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- **IPv6:** 128-bit format (`2001:db8::1`)

**Subnetting** divides networks for efficient routing, security, and resource management.

- **Subnet mask:** Separates network and host portions (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Compact notation for subnet masks, e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`.

**Example CIDR Table:**

| CIDR | Mask           | Total Hosts  | Usable Hosts |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| /24  | 255.255.255.0  | 256          | 254          |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0    | 65,536       | 65,534       |
| /8   | 255.0.0.0      | 16,777,216   | 16,777,214   |

Subnetting is essential in cloud VPC design and Kubernetes Pod networking.

## Domain Name System (DNS)
**DNS** translates human-friendly domains to machine-readable IP addresses.

**Flow example:**

Browser → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative DNS → IP address.

**Record types:**

| Type  | Description              |
|-------|--------------------------|
| A     | IPv4 address             |
| AAAA  | IPv6 address             |
| CNAME | Canonical name alias     |
| MX    | Mail exchange            |
| TXT   | Text record (often validation) |
| PTR   | Reverse DNS lookup       |

DNS misconfigurations are a frequent cause of pipeline and microservice failures.

## HTTP and HTTPS
**HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) governs data communication over the web.  
**HTTPS** adds encryption via **TLS/SSL**.

**Key HTTP Methods:**
- `GET`: Retrieve a resource
- `POST`: Create a resource
- `PUT`: Update a resource
- `DELETE`: Remove a resource

**Response Codes:**
- 2xx: Success
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client Error
- 5xx: Server Error

HTTP plays a central role in REST APIs and cloud services; HTTPS ensures secure CI/CD communication.

---

## Firewalls
**Firewalls** secure networks by filtering traffic based on IPs, ports, and protocols.

**Types:**
- **Network Firewalls:** Protect entire networks (e.g., AWS Security Groups).
- **Host-based Firewalls:** Control traffic for individual machines (`iptables`, `ufw`).

DevOps engineers configure firewalls to restrict SSH (port 22) or allow inbound web traffic (80, 443).

---

## Load Balancers
**Load balancers** distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers or microservices.

**Types:**
- **Layer 4 (Transport):** Routes based on IP and port.
- **Layer 7 (Application):** Routes based on content, header, or URL (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX).

They ensure **high availability**, **scalability**, and **redundancy** in CI/CD and Kubernetes deployments.

---

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A **VPN** creates secure, encrypted tunnels for remote or inter-site communication.

**Protocols:** IPSec, OpenVPN, WireGuard.

**DevOps usage:**
- Secure cloud access
- CI/CD runners in private networks
- Hybrid cloud communication

VPNs are vital for securely managing servers or private build agents.

---

## Network Troubleshooting Tools
Essential tools for diagnosing network issues:

- **Ping:** Checks connectivity.
- **Traceroute:** Identifies packet hop paths.
- **Netstat:** Displays open ports and active connections.
- **Nslookup / dig:** Queries DNS records.
- **Nmap:** Scans networks for live hosts or open ports.

These are used for verifying port access between Jenkins, Kubernetes clusters, and cloud VMs.
